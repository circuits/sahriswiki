   Comments by Adam Clarke

   Psalms 109:4 Ps 109:4

   Verse 4. For my love they are my adversaries] In their behalf I have
   performed many acts of kindness, and they are my adversaries
   notwithstanding; this shows principles the most vicious, and hearts the
   most corrupt. Many of the fathers and commentators have understood the
   principal part of the things spoken here as referring to our Lord, and the
   treatment he received from the Jews; and whatever the original intention
   was, they may safely be applied to this case, as the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and
   5th verses are as highly illustrative of the conduct of the Jewish rulers
   towards our Lord as the following verses are of the conduct of Judas; but
   allowing these passages to be prophetic, it is the Jewish state rather
   than an individual, against which these awful denunciations are made, as
   it seems to be represented here under the person and character of an
   extremely hardened and wicked man; unless we consider the curses to be
   those of David's enemies. See ACC for Ps 109:20.

   But I give myself unto prayer] hlpt ynaw vaani thephillah; "And I prayer."
   The Chaldee: ylua anaw vaana atsalley, "but I pray." This gives a good
   sense, which is followed by the Vulgate, Septuagint, AEthiopic, Arabic,
   and Anglo-Saxon. The Syriac, "I will pray for them." This, not so
   correctly; as dreadful imprecations, not prayers, follow. But probably the
   whole ought to be interpreted according to the mode laid down, Ps 109:20.
   The translation and paraphrase in the old Psalter are very simple:-

   Trans. For that thyng that thai sulde hafe lufed me, thai bakbited me; bot
   I prayed.

   Par. That is, that sulde haf lufed me for I was godson, and thai bakbited
   me sayande, in Belzebub he castes oute fendes; bot I prayed for thaim.
