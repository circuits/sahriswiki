=== Features ===

**BackLinks:**
* [[SahrisWiki]] includes support for displaying [[BackLinks]], pages that refer to the current page.

**Searching:**
* [[SahrisWiki]] includes a powerful cache-able full-text search thanks to [[http://hatta.sheep.art.pl/|Hatta]].

**Caching:**
* [[SahrisWiki]]'s RESTFul/CRUD backend sends an ETag containing the page's revision node allowing all AJAX Requests for page data to be cached by browser speeding things up greatly.
** Auto Generated pages such as [[Index]], [[History]], and others; use the repository revision node.
