== Index Fallback ==
**Status**: DONE

* **-i/--index** option/config to be a list of defaults to fallback to.
* If a user tries to view ##/foo/bar/## and bar is a sub-directory of foo then an
  index (//as specified by the -i/--index option//) will be searched for and
  displayed.

----

== Breadcrumbs ==
**Status**: Proposed

When accessing a wiki in subpages (such as this Ideas wiki under Docs then Development), provide some means of linking to it's parents such as Docs / Development , being separate links back up to their default index.  

----

== Embed Search to Not Found Results ==
**Status**: Proposed

When trying to access a wiki that does not exist (for example typing /wikiformatting vs /WikiFormatting), maybe have a brief "Did you mean:" listing out wiki pages that may match closely to the requested title.

----

== Selective Note on New Pages ==
**Status**: Proposed

In the context of creating a new page under an already existing subfolder, the following note is shown.

<<code lang="text">>
NOTE: This page's parent is http://wiki.kbeezie.com/Docs/Development. If you create http://wiki.kbeezie.com/Docs/Development/RoadMap it's parent will be renamed to an index page.
<</code>>

The suggestion would be that if the location being requested is already a subfolder (ie: check to see if for example /Docs/Development/Index already exists), then do not show the Note, otherwise show the note when appropriate (either Index does not exist, or if easier to see if the parent is already a folder).
