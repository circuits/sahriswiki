== Index Fallback ==
**Status**: DONE

* **-i/--index** option/config to be a list of defaults to fallback to.
* If a user tries to view ##/foo/bar/## and bar is a sub-directory of foo then an
  index (//as specified by the -i/--index option//) will be searched for and
  displayed.

== Breadcrumbs ==
**Status**: Proposed

When accessing a wiki in subpages (such as this Ideas wiki under Docs then Development), provide some means of linking to it's parents such as Docs / Development , being separate links back up to their default index.
