3. Login as root (no password required).
4. Create (if necessary) and format the partition(s) you want CRUX to be
     installed on.

 $ fdisk /dev/discs/disc?/disc
 $ mkreiserfs /dev/discs/disc?/part?
 $ mkswap /dev/discs/disc?/part?

     The amount of disk space you need depends on how many packages you choose
     to install. I recommend having at least a 1G root partition (CRUX will use
     about 200MB-500MB depending on your configuration).

     Using ReiserFS is recommended, but there is support for Ext2fs/Ext3fs, XFS
     and JFS as well. Further, I highly recommend separating system data from
     user data, i.e. use a separate partition for /home (and possibly /var)
     since that will make your life a lot easier the day you want to
     upgrade/reinstall/remove your system.

     [Note] Note                                
            Make sure that any BIOS Virus Protection option is DISABLED as this
            option may prevent fdisk from writing new partitions correctly.

  5. Mount the partition on which you want to install this distribution.

 $ mount /dev/discs/disc?/part? /mnt

     If you want the installation to span more than one partition, mount those
     partitions as well. For example, if you want to have a different partition
     for /home or /var, then do:

 $ mkdir /mnt/var
 $ mount /dev/discs/disc?/part? /mnt/var

  6. Activate your swap partition(s).

 $ swapon /dev/discs/disc?/part?

  7. Type setup to start the package installation script. The script will ask
     where you mounted your new root partition and which packages you want to
     install. Just select the packages you want and nothing else will be
     installed. However, I recommend at least installing all the packages
     marked base.

     Once it has installed the selected packages, the setup script will display
     an installation log. Make sure the last line in the log says "0 error(s)".

     If you at a later stage find that you need some additional packages you
     can just mount the CRUX CD-ROM and use pkgadd to install them.

     [Note] Note                                 
            There is no package dependency checking. This means that it is up
            to you to figure out that if you for example install the sendmail
            package you also need to install the db package.

  8. Now it's time to compile your kernel and do basic system configuration.
     The kernel compilation requires that you "chroot" into your new CRUX
     installation.

 $ mount -t devfs devfs /mnt/dev
 $ mount -t proc proc /mnt/proc
 $ chroot /mnt /bin/bash

  9. Set the root password.

 $ passwd

 10. Edit /etc/fstab to configure your filesystem(s). Editors vim and pico are
     available.

 11. Edit /etc/rc.conf to configure font, keyboard, timezone, hostname and
     services. See Section 5.1.3, "Configuration Variables in /etc/rc.conf" for
     details about /etc/rc.conf.

 12. Edit /etc/rc.d/net, /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf to configure your
     network (ip-address/gateway/hostname/domain/dns).

 13. Go to /usr/src/linux-2.6.6, configure and compile a new kernel.

 $ cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.6
 $ make menuconfig
 $ make all
 $ make modules_install
 $ cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage /vmlinuz
 $ cp System.map /

     Remember to enable the following kernel options:

 Code maturity level options  --->
       [*] Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers

 File systems  --->
    Pseudo filesystems  --->
       [*] /dev file system support
       [*]   Automatically mount at boot

 14. Edit /etc/lilo.conf to boot the kernel you just compiled and run lilo to
     make the new system bootable.

 15. Remove the CRUX CD-ROM from your drive and reboot from harddisk.

 16. Login as root
