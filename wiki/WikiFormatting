== General Notes ==

All text is entered as plain text, and will be converted to XHTML entities as necessary.  This means that {{{<}}}, {{{>}}}, {{{&}}},
and so on are converted for you (//except in special situations where the characters are Wiki markup, [[SahrisWiki]] is generally smart enough to know when to convert and when not to).

Just hit "return" twice to make a paragraph break. If you want to
force a line break between two lines, use the {{{\\}}} special
character sequence at the end of the line and press "return" once.
This will force a hard line break.

== Inline Formatting ==

|| {{{//emphasis//}}}                  || //emphasis//                ||
|| {{{**strong**}}}                    || **strong**                  ||
|| {{{//**emphasis and strong**//}}}   || //**emphasis and strong**// ||
|| {{{**//strong and emphasis//**}}}   || **//strong and emphasis//** ||
|| {{{{{{teletype text}}}}}}           || {{{teletype text}}}         ||
|| {{{super ^^1^^ script}}}            || super ^^1^^ script          ||

== Literal Text

If you don't want [[SahrisWiki]] to parse some text, enclose it in
surrounding braces.

{{{
This //text// gets **parsed**.

{{{This //text// does not get **parsed**.}}}
}}}

This //text// gets **parsed**.

{{{This //text// does not get **parsed**.}}}

== Headings ==

You can make various levels of heading by putting equals-signs before and after the text (//all on its own line//):

{{{
= Level 1 Heading =
== Level 2 Heading ==
=== Level 3 Heading ===
==== Level 4 Heading ====
===== Level 5 Heading =====
====== Level 6 Heading ======
}}}

= Level 1 Heading =
== Level 2 Heading ==
=== Level 3 Heading ===
==== Level 4 Heading ====
===== Level 5 Heading =====
====== Level 6 Heading ======

== Horizontal Rules
Use four dashes ({{{----}}}) to create a horizontal rule:

== Lists ==

=== Bullet Lists ==

You can create bullet lists by starting a paragraph with one or more asterisks. The more asterisks indicate indentation level.

{{{
* Item 1
** Item 1a
* Item 2
}}}

* Item 1
** Item 1a
* Item 2

=== Numbered Lists ==

Similarly, you can create numbered lists by starting a paragraph with one or more hashes. The more hashes used indicate level.

{{{
# Item 1
# Item 2
## Item 2.1
### Item 2.1.1
# Item 3
}}}

# Item 1
# Item 2
## Item 2.1
### Item 2.1.1
# Item 3

=== Mixing Bullet and Number List Items ==

You can mix and match bullet and number lists:

{{{
# Item 1
** Item aa
** Item ab
# Item 2
** Item 2a
** Item 2b
*** Item 2b (a)
#### Item 2.1
#### Item 2.2
# Item 3
** Item 3a
** Item 3b
}}}


# Item 1
** Item aa
** Item ab
# Item 2
** Item 2a
** Item 2b
*** Item 2b (a)
#### Item 2.1
#### Item 2.2
# Item 3
** Item 3a
** Item 3b


=== Definition Lists ==

You can create a definition (description) list with the following syntax:

<<code>>
;Item 1: Something
;Item 2: Something else
<</code>>

;Item 1: Something
;Item 2: Something else

----

== Block Quotes

You can mark a blockquote by starting a line with one or more '>' \\
characters, followed by a space and the text to be quoted.

<<code>>
This is normal text here.

> Indent me! The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \\
Now this the time for all good men to come to the aid of \\
their country. Notice how we can continue the block-quote \\
in the same "paragraph" by using a backslash at the end of \\
the line.
>
> Another block, leading to...
>> Second level of indenting.  This second is indented even \\
more than the previous one.

Back to normal text.
<</code>>

This is normal text here.

> Indent me! The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \\
Now this the time for all good men to come to the aid of \\
their country. Notice how we can continue the block-quote \\
in the same "paragraph" by using a backslash at the end of \\
the line.
>
> Another block, leading to...
>> Second level of indenting.  This second is indented even \\
more than the previous one.

Back to normal text.

== Links and Images

=== Wiki Links

SmashWordsTogether to create a page link.

You can force a WikiPage name '''not''' to be clickable by putting \\
an exclamation mark in front of it.

{{{WikiPage !WikiPage}}}

WikiPage !WikiPage

(Note: existing wiki pages must be in the Text_Wiki {{pages}} option array, \\
and the {{view_url}} option must be set for the linking to work.)

You can refer to an anchor on a WikiPage using a hash mark: WikiPage#named_anchor

You can make a "described" wiki link by putting it in brackets and following it \\
with a nice text label:

{{{This is a [WikiPage#named_anchor link to a wiki page] -- cool!}}}

This is a [WikiPage#named_anchor link to a wiki page] -- cool!


=== Interwiki Links

Interwiki links are links to pages on other Wiki sites. \\
Type the {{``SiteName:PageName``}} like this:

* MeatBall:RecentChanges
* Advogato:proj/WikkiTikkiTavi
* Wiki:WorseIsBetter

(Note: the interwiki site must be in the Text_Wiki {{interwiki}} option array.)

=== URLs

Create a remote link simply by typing its URL: http://ciaweb.net.

If you like, enclose it in brackets to create a numbered reference \\
and avoid cluttering the page; {{{##[[http://ciaweb.net/free/]]##}}} becomes ##[[http://ciaweb.net/free/]]##.

Or you can have a described-reference instead of a numbered reference:

{{{##[[http://pear.php.net|PEAR]]##}}}

##[[http://pear.php.net|PEAR]]##

=== Images

You can put a picture in a page by typing the URL to the picture \\
(it must end in gif, jpg, or png).
<<code>>
{{http://c2.com/sig/wiki.gif}}
<</code>>

{{http://c2.com/sig/wiki.gif}}

You can use the described-reference URL markup to give the image an ALT tag:
<<code>>
{{+download/fuckcat.jpg|F**K YOU I'm a Cat!}}
<</code>>

{{+download/fuckcat.jpg|F**K YOU I'm a Cat!}}


----
== Code Blocks

Create code blocks by using {{<code>...</code>}} tags (each on its own line).

<code>
This is an example code block!
</code>


To create PHP blocks that get automatically colorized when you use PHP tags, \\
simply surround the code with {{<php>...</php>}} tags (the tags themselves \\
should each be on their own lines, and no need for the {{<?php ... ?>}} tags).

<code>
<php>
// Set up the wiki options
$options = array();
$options['view_url'] = "index.php?page=";

// load the text for the requested page
$text = implode('', file($page . '.wiki.txt'));

// create a Wiki objext with the loaded options
$wiki = new Text_Wiki($options);

// transform the wiki text.
echo $wiki->transform($text);
</php>
</code>

<php>
// Set up the wiki options
$options = array();
$options['view_url'] = "index.php?page=";

// load the text for the requested page
$text = implode('', file($page . '.wiki.txt'));

// create a Wiki objext with the loaded options
$wiki = new Text_Wiki($options);

// transform the wiki text.
echo $wiki->transform($text);
</php>

----

== Tables

You can create tables using pairs of vertical bars:

<<code>>
|| **column one** || **column two** ||
|||| extended line ||
|| cell four || cell five ||
|| cell six || here's a very long cell ||
<</code>>

|| **column one** || **column two** ||
|||| extended line ||
|| cell four || cell five ||
|| cell six || here's a very long cell ||

<<code>>
|| lines must start and end || with double vertical bars || nothing ||
|| cells are separated by || double vertical bars || nothing ||
|||| you can span multiple columns by || starting each cell ||
|| with extra cell |||| separators ||
|||||| but perhaps an example is the easiest way to see ||
