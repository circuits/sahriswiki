== Wiki Formatting ==

This wiki uses the [[http://wikicreole.org|WikiCreole]] syntax.

Creole markup should be easy to remember. A measurement for this is the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two|Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]] rule. If you group the markup into functional areas, we almost archived that goal (If you count nowiki and preformatted as "advanced", and group horizontal rule to paragraphs we indeed did ;-) ): 

1. Emphasis, 2.Lists, 3.Links, 4.Headings, 5.Paragraphs, 6.Images, 7.Tables

Advanced: Nowiki, Placeholder

== Text Formatting Rules ==

You can use Creole markup format when editing pages on this site. 

**Paragraphs** are created by simply typing the text. To separate paragraphs, just leave an empty line between them. Line ends will be preserved inside paragraphs. You can use "{{{\\}}}" to force a line break most everywhere.

**Emphasis** can be marked {{{//like this//}}} or {{{**like this**}}}, to produce //italic text// or **bold text**.

**Link** to a {{{[[wiki page]]}}} will render as [[wiki page]]. You can also use {{{[[wiki page|different text]]}}} that will show [[wiki page|different text]]. Web page addresses, like {{{[[http://wikicreole.org|WikiCreole]]}}} can be also used and will display as [[http://wikicreole.org|WikiCreole]].

**Images** are included with {{{{{http://www.wikicreole.org/templates/creole/images/viki.png|WikiCreole Logo}} }}}, the text is displayed when the image cannot be shown. You can put images inside links: {{{[[http://wikicreole.org|{{http://www.wikicreole.org/templates/creole/images/viki.png|WikiCreole Logo}}]]}}}.

**No markup** is in effect if you type text {{{{{{like this}}}}}}, or when you need several lines like this:
{{{
{{{
line 1
line 2
line 3
~}}}
}}}

**Headings** are created like this:
{{{
== Section heading ==
=== Subsection heading ===
==== Subsubsection heading ====
}}}

**Bullet lists** are created like this:
{{{
* first item
* second item
** first subitem of second item
* third item
}}}

**Numbered lists** are made like this:
{{{
# first item
# second item
## first subitem of second item
# third item
}}}

**Tables** can be made easily:
{{{
| first row first column | first row second column |
| second row first column | second row second column |
}}}

**Horizontal line**, like this one
----
can be used to separate parts of text, you just need to type:
{{{
----
}}}

This wiki also supports Iñtërnâtiônàlizætiøn.

Creole syntax test

----
The following is a test of WikiCreole:

= Top-level heading (1)
== This a test for creole 0.1 (2)
=== This is a Subheading (3)
==== Subsub (4)
===== Subsubsub (5)

The ending equal signs should not be displayed:

= Top-level heading (1) =
== This a test for creole 0.1 (2) ==
=== This is a Subheading (3) ===
==== Subsub (4) ====
===== Subsubsub (5) =====


You can make things **bold** or //italic// or **//both//** or //**both**//.

Character formatting extends across line breaks: **bold,
this is still bold. This line deliberately does not end in star-star.

Not bold. Character formatting does not cross paragraph boundaries.

You can use [[internal links]] or [[http://www.wikicreole.org|external links]],
give the link a [[internal links|different]] name.

Here's another sentence: This wisdom is taken from [[Ward Cunningham's]]
[[http://www.c2.com/doc/wikisym/WikiSym2006.pdf|Presentation at the Wikisym 06]].

Here's a external link without a description: [[http://www.wikicreole.org]]

Free links without braces should be rendered as well, like http://www.wikicreole.org/ and http://www.wikicreole.org/users/~example. 

Note: the implementation should not render foo://bar as italic! It's not enough to
protect http://bar from being rendered as italic, because you can have much more
protocols, for example jdbc://bar and ftp://file.

You can use this to draw a line to separate the page:
----

You can use lists, start it at the first column for now, please...

unnumbered lists are like
* item a
* item b
* **bold item c**

blank space is also permitted before lists like:
  *   item a
 * item b
* item c
 ** item c.a

or you can number them
# [[item 1]]
# item 2
# // italic item 3 //
    ## item 3.1
  ## item 3.2

up to five levels
* 1
** 2
*** 3
**** 4
***** 5

* You can have
multiline list items
* this is a second multiline
list item

You can use nowiki syntax if you would like do stuff like this:

{{{
Guitar Chord C:

||---|---|---|
||-0-|---|---|
||---|-0-|---|
||---|---|-0-|
||---|---|---|
~}}}

Note: if you look at the source code of the above, you see the escape char (tilde, ~ )
being used to escape the closing triple curly braces. This is to do nesting because
all this text is enclosed in nowiki markup.
}}}

You can also use it inline nowiki {{{ in a sentence }}} like this.

= Escapes =
Normal Link: http://wikicreole.org/ - now same link, but escaped: ~http://wikicreole.org/ 

Normal asterisks: ~**not bold~**

a tilde alone: ~

a tilde escapes itself: ~~xxx

=== Creole 0.2 ===

This should be a flower with the ALT text "this is a flower" if your wiki supports ALT text on images:

{{Red_Flower.jpg|here is a red flower}}

=== Creole 0.4 ===

Tables are done like this:

|=header col1|=header col2| 
|col1|col2| 
|you         |can         | 
|also        |align\\ it. | 

You can format an address by simply forcing linebreaks:

My contact dates:\\
Pone: xyz\\
Fax: +45\\
Mobile: abc

=== Creole 0.5 ===

|= Header title               |= Another header title     |
| {{{ //not italic text// }}} | {{{ **not bold text** }}} |
| //italic text//             | **  bold text **          |

=== Creole 1.0 ===

If interwiki links are setup in your wiki, this links to the WikiCreole page about Creole 1.0 test cases: [[WikiCreole:Creole1.0TestCases]].
