prologic: why is it #PageName? -[[ThomasWaldmann]]

hmm I guess I know of no other way to do history/bookmarks with an AJAX based wiki at least the [[http://digitarald.de/projects/|HistoryManager]] [[http://mootools.net|mootools]] class I"m using is responsible for this behavior. -[[prologic]]

well, usually it should be PageName#anchor_name -[[ThomasWaldmann]]

I suppose you're right. I'll look into changing it thanks for the tip :) now that I think about it - it should work -[[prologic]]
